"""Static configuration of the synthetic securities lending book.

Money is USD millions everywhere in the engine; the app formats to $B and
$M. Nothing here is a real institution, client or price.

Two sides to every position: the securities lent out (the loan side)
and what the borrower posted against them (the collateral side). Each
side is a basket drawn from an asset class. The class index moves both
baskets, but the baskets are not the same securities, so each carries
its own basket noise on top.
