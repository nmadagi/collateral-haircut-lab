"""Synthetic prices and positions for the lending book.

Prices: three years of business days, one index per asset class driven
by three common factors (equity, rates, credit) with fat-tailed shocks,
and a planted six-week stress episode in the second year where equities
and credit sell off, volatility triples and Treasuries rally. Every
class then has two baskets, the securities lent out and the securities
received as collateral, each the index plus its own basket noise.

Positions: for every borrower, a few dozen to a few hundred individual
loans split across the borrower's (loan class, collateral class) mix.
Collateral is what the borrower held at the previous close, which is the
requirement plus that borrower's habitual buffer. The as-of day's price
move is what the exposure monitor then marks.

Fixed seed, so every run is the same book.
